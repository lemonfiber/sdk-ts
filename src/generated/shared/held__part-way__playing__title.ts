/**
 * The kinds of thing a household holds.
 *
 * Named rather than passed through as the server's own word, because a surface
 * drawing "Series" against one server and "tvshow" against another would be
 * rendering a detail of which server this household runs.
 *
 * `Medium` rather than `Kind`, `Holding` or `Sort`: this product already calls the two
 * request services a [`crate::media::Kind`], a request's suspension a
 * [`crate::service::asking::Holding`], and what one line of a manifest is a
 * `uninstall::Sort` — and one word meaning two things in one vocabulary is how a
 * reader comes to trust the wrong one. The contract flattens every type name into one
 * namespace, so a clash there is a clash for anything reading it by name.
